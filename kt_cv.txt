Project: Birbank RebootX (DWH) project (Currently going on)
Technologies: Impala, Airflow, Hue
Summary: I led the team responsible for source system analysis and data mapping on the Birbank RebootX data warehouse project. My main role was to guide my team in studying our various data sources to fully understand the data's structure and the business rules behind it. We then created the detailed mapping documents that acted as a clear guide for the development team, showing them exactly how to move data from the old systems to the new warehouse.

Summary: I contributed significantly to the development of the data mart component within the new data warehouse model for Boyner, one of Turkey’s leading companies in the e-commerce and retail sectors. Collaborating closely with various business units, I analyzed their data requirements and translated these needs into effective data models. 
My responsibilities included designing and creating data mappings to ensure data flow from source systems to the data mart. I also conducted comprehensive testing to validate the accuracy and integrity of the data. The ETL processes were developed using Oracle Data Integrator 12c, ensuring that data was accurately loaded into the data mart tables. This structured data was then made available for analysis and reporting through the MicroStrategy tool, facilitating informed decision-making across the organization.
